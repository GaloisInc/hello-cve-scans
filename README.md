# Introduction #

This repository contains minimal Python, Rust, and Haskell projects
that provide hello-world-ish projects where we can test the
capabilities of CVE scan tools for each language.

We also describe what github's dependabot can bring to the table
(generally not highly recommended, see below).

# CVE Scanning
## CVE-Scans General Issues

*AKA: build, then scan*

Each audit/scan tool must deal with
 - dependency on the build tool
   - pkg constraints (manifest/spec/?) vs the actual packages used
   - does the dependency specif. match the code
     - if 'dead' packages

 - transitive or not
   - not an issue if scan based on x.lock file that includes full set
     of dependencies

 - distinguishing dependencies
   - run-time
   - build-time, test-targets, other-targets

Ramifications / Best practices
 - build;cve-scan may not be deterministic:
   - depends on CVE db [way to capture?], should capture date
   - depends on the "package database"!
 - thus, ideally we should
   - build; commit x.lock file; cve-scan > _ (and add ?)
   -

Issues with "testing/exploring"
 - want to set pkg versions to exercise the scanner, but if build tool
   overrides, ugh.

Other issues
 - fine or coarse grained dependencies

## Rust CVE Scanning with `cargo audit`

Let's start with CVE scanning for rust, the easiest case.
First, install the `cargo-audit` tool
```
   cargo install cargo-audit
```

To run it on our project, do
```
   cd rust-project/
   cargo update    # create/update the Cargo.lock.
   cargo audit
```
and you should then see
```
    Fetching advisory database from `https://github.com/RustSec/advisory-db.git`
      Loaded 645 security advisories (from /Users/tullsen/.cargo/advisory-db)
    Updating crates.io index
    Scanning Cargo.lock for vulnerabilities (7 crate dependencies)
Crate:     time
Version:   0.1.45
Title:     Potential segfault in the time crate
Date:      2020-11-18
ID:        RUSTSEC-2020-0071
URL:       https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2020-0071
Severity:  6.2 (medium)
Solution:  Upgrade to >=0.2.23
Dependency tree:
time 0.1.45
└── rust-project 0.1.0

error: 1 vulnerability found!
```
The command returns an error code to indicate a CVE vulnerability has been found.
```
rust-project $ echo $?
1
```

See the (commented) `Cargo.toml` file: you can comment out the `time`
package and re-run `cargo audit` to see that it now determines there
are no known CVE vulnerabilities.

A few things to note here
 - `cargo audit` will call `cargo update` so you can dispense
    with the latter.
 - `cargo update` follows all crate dependencies and creates/updates
    the Cargo.toml, thus we find the indirect dependencies and CVE
    vulnerabalities.
 - `cargo update` may override crate versions specified in the
   `Cargo.toml` file as part of "dependency resolution" when it
   creates the `Cargo.lock` file.  This might be surprising, but this
   is the ``right thing''.

Also, we have provided a `.github/dependabot.yml` along with *...*


## Thoughts on dependabot

In light of above comments, I'd recommend against dependabot as a
reliable source for CVE warnings.  I'd say
dependabot is most useful as
 - a very low overhead [turn on in github.com] cve check
that works best for
 - supported languages
 - single package per repo, using the standard [for the language]
   build mechanisms.

Can be useful for
 - autogenerated PRs that update pkg versions.
